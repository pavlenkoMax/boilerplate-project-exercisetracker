This is the boilerplate for the Exercise Tracker project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker

# TODO:
- add sqlite db
- add from, to and limit parameters to a /api/users/:_id/logs request to retrieve part of the log of any user. from and to are dates in yyyy-mm-dd format. limit is an integer of how many logs to send back.
- Can you have more than one user with the same username?
- Does your api handle database errors gracefully
- Does it handle user input in a secure way (preventing SQL injections)?
